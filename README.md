# cocktail-app

Welcome to my Cocktail App: A B C Drinkie-poos.

A single page application made with Create React App which simply allows users to browse through a variety of cocktails, add favourites to their own list, and create their own cocktails to add to the list. 

While the style and layout appears simple I think the app has potential to be more visually appealling and to have more functionality, such as search filters that allow the user to browse by cocktail name or by type of liquor. 

So when you're done work for the day and you're ready for a drinkie-poo just head to your favourites and mix something up!
